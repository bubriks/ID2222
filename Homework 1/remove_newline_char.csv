Mechanism Design",Multiagent Systems,"we introduce a sealed bid auction of a single item in which the winner is chosen at random among the highest k bidders according to a fixed probability distribution, and the price for the chosen winner is the vickrey-clarke-groves price. we call such an auction a cascade auction. our analysis suggests that this type of auction may give higher revenues compared to second price auction in cases of collusion."

Reinforcement Learning
Sequential Decision Making","Machine Learning
Reasoning under Uncertainty","this paper presents a new approach to basis adaptation in reinforcement learning (rl) using the recently proposed { mirror-descent} framework. mirror descent can be viewed as an enhanced gradient method, particularly suited to minimization of convex functions in high-dimensional spaces. unlike traditional gradient methods, mirror descent undertakes gradient updates of weights in both the dual space and primal space, which are linked together using a legendre transform. mirror descent can be viewed as a proximal algorithm where the distance generating function used is a bregman divergence. we introduce a general framework for nonlinear separable value function approximation based on finding frechet gradients of an error function based on variable projection functionals. we then show how to combine basis adaptation methods with proximal-gradient based temporal-difference (td) methods and present a new class of regularized td methods, which combine feature selection through sparse $l_1$ regularization and basis adaptation. experimental results are provided to illustrate and validate the approach."
2,Optimal Coalition Structures in Cooperative Graph Games,cooperative game theory coalition structure generation optimal coalition structure deng and papadimitriou's cooperative graph game planar graphs minor free graphs,"Coordination and Collaboration
Game Theory",Multiagent Systems,"representation languages for coalitional games are a key research area in algorithmic game theory. there is an inherent tradeoff between how general a language is, allowing it to capture more elaborate games, and how hard it is computationally to optimize and solve such games. one prominent such language is the simple yet expressive weighted graph games (wggs) representation (deng and papadimitriou, 1994), which maintains knowledge about synergies between agents in the form of an edge weighted graph. we consider the problem of finding the optimal coalition structure in wggs. the agents in such games are vertices in a graph, and the value of a coalition is the sum of the weights of the edges present between coalition members. the optimal coalition structure is a partition of the agents to coalitions, that maximizes the sum of utilities obtained by the coalitions. we show that finding the optimal coalition structure is not only hard for general graphs, but is also intractable for restricted families such as planar graphs which are amenable for many other combinatorial problems. we then provide algorithms with constant factor approximations for planar, minor-free and bounded degree graphs."

Evaluation and Analysis (Search and Optimization)
Search (General/Other)",Heuristic Search and Optimization,"multiple sequence alignment (msa) is a central problem in computational biology. it is well known that msa can be formulated as a shortest path problem and solved using heuristic search, but the memory requirement of a* makes it impractical for all but the smallest problems. partial expansion a* (pea*) reduces the space complexity of a* by generating only the most promising successor nodes. however, even pea* exhausts available memory on many problems. another alternative is iterative deepening dynamic programming, which uses an uninformed search order but stores only the nodes along the search frontier. however, it too cannot scale to the largest problems. in this paper, we propose storing nodes on cheap and plentiful secondary storage. we present a new general-purpose algorithm, parallel external pea* (pe2a*), that combines pea* with delayed duplicate detection to take advantage of external memory and multiple processors to solve large msa problems. in our experiments, pe2a* is the first algorithm capable of solving the entire reference set 1 of the standard balibase benchmark using a biologically accurate cost function. this work suggests that external best-first search can effectively use heuristic information to surpass methods that rely on predefined search orders."

Mechanism Design",Multiagent Systems,"we propose a new market design for display advertising contracts, based on posted prices. this requires overcoming major challenges: (i) the space of possible impression types is exponential in the number of attributes, which is typically large; therefore a complete price space cannot be maintained; (ii) the level of detail with which supply and demand are specified are often not identical, (iii) advertisers are usually unable to provide extensive demand (willingness-to-pay) functions."
5,Gradient Networks for Shape-Based Object Instance Detection,object detection instance detection shape gradient networks,"Vision, Object Recognition, and Perception",Robotics,"we present a novel framework for shape-based template matching in images. while previous approaches required brittle contour extraction, considered only local information, or used coarse statistics, we propose to match the shape explicitly on low-level gradients by formulating the problem as traversing paths in a gradient network. we evaluate our algorithm on a challenging dataset of objects in cluttered environments and demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods for shape matching and object detection."
6,Unified Constraint Propagation on Multi-View Data,pairwise constraint propagation semi-supervised learning multi-view data,"Relational/Graph-Based Learning
Semisupervised Learning",Machine Learning,"this paper presents a unified framework for intra-view and inter-view constraint propagation on multi-view data from a semi-supervised learning viewpoint. in the literature, pairwise constraint propagation has been studied extensively, where each pairwise constraint is defined over a pair of data points from a single view. in contrast, very little attention has been paid to inter-view constraint propagation, which is more challenging since each pairwise constraint is now defined over a pair of data points from different views. although both intra-view and inter-view constraint propagation are crucial for multi-view tasks, most previous methods cannot handle them simultaneously. to address this challenging issue, we propose to decompose these two types of constraint propagation into semi-supervised learning subproblems so that they can be uniformly solved based on the traditional label propagation techniques. to further integrate them into a unified framework, we utilize the results of intra-view constraint propagation to adjust the similarity matrix of each view and then perform inter-view constraint propagation with the adjusted similarity matrices. the experimental results in cross-view retrieval have demonstrated the superior performance of our unified constraint propagation."
7,Progression of Decomposed Situation Calculus Theories,reasoning about actions decomposition of logical theories situation calculus basic action theory progression forgetting decomposability inseparability,"Action, Change, and Causality",Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,"in many tasks related to reasoning about consequences of a logical theory, it is desirable to decompose the theory into a number of components with weakly-related or independent signatures. this facilitates reasoning when signature of a query formula belongs to only one of the components. however, a theory may be subject to change due to execution of actions affecting features mentioned in the theory. having once computed a decomposition of a theory, one would like to know whether a decomposition has to be computed again in the theory obtained from taking into account all changes resulting from execution of an action. in the paper, we address this problem in the scope of the situation calculus, where change of an initial theory is related to the well-studied notion of progression. progression provides a form of forward reasoning; it relies on forgetting values of those features which are subject to change and computing new values for them. we prove new results about properties of decomposition components under forgetting and show when a decomposition can be preserved in progression of an initial situation calculus theory."

Social Choice / Voting",Multiagent Systems,"for decades researchers have struggled with the problem of envy-free cake cutting: how to divide a divisible good between multiple agents so that each agent likes his own allocation best. although an envy-free cake cutting protocol was ultimately devised, it is unbounded, in the sense that the number of operations can be arbitrarily large, depending on the preferences of the agents. we ask whether bounded protocols exist when the agents' preferences are restricted. our main result is an envy-free cake cutting protocol for agents with piecewise linear valuations, which requires a number of operations that is polynomial in natural parameters of the given instance."

Knowledge-Based Systems
Machine Learning","recent years have witnessed the success of hashing techniques in approximate nearest neighbor search. in practice, multiple hash tables are usually employed to retrieve more desired results from all hit buckets of each table. however, there are rare works studying the unified approach to constructing multiple informative hash tables except the widely used random way. in this paper, we regard the table construction as a selection problem over a set of candidate hash functions. with the graph representation of the function set, we propose an efficient solution that sequentially applies normalized dominant set to finding the most informative and independent hash functions for each table. to further reduce the redundancy between tables, we explore the reciprocal hash tables in a boosting manner, where the hash function graph is updated with high weights emphasized on the misclassified neighbor pairs of previous hash tables. the construction method is general and compatible with different types of hashing algorithms using different feature spaces and/or parameter settings. extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both naive construction method and state-of-the-art hashing algorithms, with up to 65.93% accuracy gains."

Heuristic Search and Optimization","stochastic local search (sls) algorithms are well known for their ability to efficiently find models of randomly generated instances of the boolean satisfiablity (sat) problem. one of the most famous sls algorithms for sat is walksat, which is an initial algorithm that has wide influence among modern sls algorithms. recently, there has been increasing interest in walksat, due to the discovery of its great power on large random 3-sat instances. however, the performance of walksat on random $k$-sat instances with $k>3$ lags far behind. indeed, there have been few works in improving sls algorithms for such instances. this work takes a first large step towards this direction. we propose a novel concept namely $multilevel$ $make$. based on this concept, we design a scoring function called $linear$ $make$, which is utilized to break ties in walksat, leading to a new algorithm called walksat$lm$. our experimental results on random 5-sat and 7-sat instances show that walksat$lm$ improves walksat by orders of magnitudes. moreover, walksat$lm$ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sls solvers on random 5-sat instances, while competes well on random 7-sat ones. additionally, walksat$lm$ performs very well on random instances from sat challenge 2012, indicating its robustness."

Unsupervised Learning (Other)",Machine Learning,"anomaly detection for mixed-type data is an important problem that has not been well addressed in the machine learning field. there are two challenging issues for mixed-type datasets, namely modeling mutual correlations between mixed-type attributes and capturing large variations due to anomalies. this paper presents unrebad, an unsupervised robust error buffering approach for anomaly detection in mixed-type datasets. a new variant of the generalized linear model is proposed to model the dependency between mixed-type attributes. the model incorporates an error buffering component based on student-t distribution to absorb the variations caused by anomalies. however, because of the non-gaussian design, the problem becomes analytically intractable. we propose a novel bayesian inference approach, which integrates laplace approximation and several computational optimizations, and is able to efficiently approximate the posterior of high dimensional latent variables by iteratively updating the latent variables in groups. extensive experimental evaluations based on 13 benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of unrebad."

Bayesian Networks","Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
Reasoning under Uncertainty","we address the problem of transferring causal knowledge learned in one environment to another, potentially different environment, when only limited experiments may be conducted at the source. this generalizes the treatment of transportability introduced in [pearl and bareinboim, 2011; bareinboim and pearl, 2012b], which deals with transferring causal information when any experiment can be conducted at the source. given that it is not always feasible to conduct certain controlled experiments, we consider the decision problem whether experiments on a selected subset z of variables together with qualitative assumptions encoded in a diagram may render causal effects in the target environment computable from the available data. this problem, which we call z-transportability, reduces to ordinary transportability when z is all-inclusive, and, like the latter, can be given syntactic characterization using the do-calculus [pearl, 1995; 2000]. this paper establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for causal effects in the target domain to be estimable from both the non-experimental information available and the limited experimental information transferred from the source. we further provides a complete algorithm for computing the transport formula, that is, a way of fusing experimental and observational information to synthesize an unbiased estimate of the desired causal relation."
16,Rank Aggregation via Low-rank and Structured-sparse Decomposition,rank aggregation low-rank matrices structured-sparsity meta-search,Preferences/Ranking Learning,Machine Learning,"rank aggregation, which combines multiple individual rank lists to obtain a better one, is a fundamental technique in various applications such as meta-search and recommendation systems. most existing rank aggregation methods blindly combine multiple rank lists with possibly considerable noises, which often degrades their performances. in this paper, we propose a new model for \textit{robust rank aggregation (rra)} via matrix learning, which recovers a latent rank list from the possibly incomplete and noisy input rank lists. in our model, we construct a pairwise comparison matrix to encode the order information in each input rank list. based on our observations, each comparison matrix can be naturally decomposed into a shared low-rank matrix, combined with a deviation error matrix which is the sum of a column-sparse matrix and a row-sparse one. the latent rank list can be easily extracted from the learned low-rank matrix. the optimization formulation of rra has an element-wise multiplication operator to handle missing values, a symmetric constraint on the noise structure, and a factorization trick to restrict the maximum rank of the low-rank matrix. to solve this challenging optimization problem, we propose a novel procedure based on the augmented lagrangian multiplier scheme. we conduct extensive experiments on meta-search and collaborative filtering benchmark datasets. the results show that the proposed rra has superior performance gain over several state-of-the-art algorithms for rank aggregation."
17,Computational Aspects of Nearly Single-Peaked Electorates,computational social choice (nearly) single-peaked profiles voting manipulation computational complexity algorithms,Social Choice / Voting,Multiagent Systems,"manipulation, bribery, and control are well-studied ways of changing the outcome of an election. many voting systems are in the general case computationally resistant to some of these manipulative actions. however when restricted to single-peaked electorates, these systems suddenly become easy to manipulate. recently, faliszewski, hemaspaandra, and hemaspaandra studied the complexity of dishonest behavior in nearly single-peaked electorates. these are electorates that are not single-peaked but close to it according to some distance measure. in this paper we introduce several new distance measures regarding single-peakedness. we prove that determining whether a given profile is nearly single-peaked is in many cases np-complete. for one case we present a polynomial-time algorithm. furthermore, we explore the relations between several notions of nearly single-peakedness and study the complexity of manipulation for nearly single-peaked elections."

Reasoning under Uncertainty","the increasing use of group discounts has provided opportunities for buying groups with diverse preferences to coordinate their behavior in order to exploit the best offers from multiple vendors. we analyze this problem from the viewpoint of the vendors, asking under what conditions a vendor should adopt a volume-based price schedule rather than posting a fixed price, either as a monopolist or when competing with other vendors. when vendors have uncertainty about buyers' valuations specified by a known distribution, we show that a vendor is always better off posting a fixed price, provided that buyers' types are i.i.d. and other vendors also use fixed prices. we also show that these assumptions cannot be relaxed: if buyers are not i.i.d., or other vendors post discount schedules, then posting a schedule may yield higher profit for the vendor. we provide similar results under a distribution-free uncertainty model, where vendors try to minimize their maximum regret over all type realizations."

Mechanism Design
Social Choice / Voting",Multiagent Systems,"we consider judgment aggregation over multiple independent issues, where the chairperson has her own opinion, and can try to bias the outcome by bundling several issues together. since for each bundle judges must give a uniform answer on all issues, different partitions of the issues may result in an outcome that is significantly different than the ``true'', issue-wise, decision.  we prove that the bundling problem faced by the chairperson, i.e. trying to bias the outcome towards her own opinion, is computationally difficult in the worst case. then we study the probability that an effective bundling attack exists as the disparity between the opinions of the judges and the chair varies. we show that if every judge initially agrees with the chair on every issue with probability of at least 1/2, then there is almost always a bundling attack (i.e. a partition) where the opinion of the chair on all issues is approved. moreover, such a partition can be found efficiently. in contrast, when the probability is lower than 1/2 then the chair cannot force her opinion even on a single issue."

Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery",Machine Learning,"clustering with constraints is an important and developing area. however, most work is confined to conjunctions of simple together and apart constraints which limit their usability. in this paper, we propose a new formulation of constrained clustering that is able to incorporate not only existing types of constraints but also more complex logical combinations beyond conjunctions. we first show how any statement in conjunctive normal form (cnf) can be represented as a linear inequality. since existing clustering formulations such as spectral clustering cannot easily incorporate these linear inequalities, we propose a quadratic programming (qp) clustering formulation to accommodate them. this new formulation allows us to have much more complex guidance in clustering. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two applications on text and personal information management. we also compare our algorithm against existing constrained spectral clustering algorithm to show its efficiency in computational time."

Probabilistic Inference",Reasoning under Uncertainty,"mixed probabilistic and deterministic graphical models are ubiquitous in real-world applications. unfortunately, gibbs sampling, a popular mcmc technique, does not converge to the correct answers in presence of determinism and therefore cannot be used for inference in such models. in this paper, we propose to remedy this problem by combining gibbs sampling with samplesearch, an advanced importance sampling technique which leverages complete sat/csp solvers to generate high quality samples from hard deterministic spaces. we call the resulting algorithm, giss. unlike gibbs sampling which yields unweighted samples, giss yields weighted samples. computing these weights exactly can be computationally expensive and therefore we propose several approximations. we show that our new weighting schemes yield consistent estimates and demonstrate experimentally that giss is competitive in terms of accuracy with state-of-the-art approximate inference algorithms such as samplesearch, mc-sat and belief propagation."

Multidisciplinary Topics","many negotiations in the real world are characterized by incomplete  information, and participants' success depends on their ability to  reveal information in a way that facilitates agreement without  compromising their individual gains. this paper presents a novel  agent design for repeated negotiation in incomplete information  settings that learns to reveal information strategically during the  negotiation process. the agent used classical machine learning  techniques to predict how people make and respond to offers during  the negotiation, how they reveal information, and their response to  potential revelation actions by the agent. the agent was evaluated  empirically in an extensive empirical study spanning hundreds of  human subjects. results show that the agent was able to outperform  people. it learned to (1) make offers that were beneficial to people  while not compromising its own benefit; (2) incrementally reveal  information to people in a way that increased its expected  performance. we also show the agent was successful in new settings  without the need to acquire additional data. this work demonstrates  the efficacy of combining machine learning with opponent modeling  techniques towards the design of computer agents for negotiating  with people in settings of incomplete information."
25,A Maximum K-Min Approach for Classification,classification maximin maximum k min,Classification,Machine Learning,"over the past decades, maximin/minimax classifiers have been proven to be of excellent performance in numerous applications. in this paper, a novel robust maximum k-min criterion for classification is proposed which focuses on maximizing the gain obtained by the $k$ worst-classified instances while ignoring the remaining ones.the original combinatorial explosion problem is reformulated into a convex optimization problem with linear number of inequality constrains, which can be efficiently solved via standard convex optimization methods and guarantees a global optimum solution. to verify the performance of maximum k-min approach, a naive linear maximum k-min classifier and a nonlinear maximum k-min classifier are proposed for 2-class classification. the experiment results based on $10$ datasets show that the classification accuracy of maximum k-min classifiers is competitive with the state-of-the-art classifiers of support vector machine and logistic regression."

Multiagent Systems","we study the multi-armed bandit problems with budget constraint and variable costs (mab-bv). in this setting, pulling an arm will receive a random reward together with a random cost, and the objective of an algorithm is to pull a sequence of arms in order to maximize the expected total reward with the costs of pulling those arms complying with a budget constraint. this new setting models many internet applications (e.g., ad exchange, sponsored search, and cloud computing) in a more accurate manner than previous settings where the pulling of arms is either costless or with a fixed cost. we propose two ucb based algorithms for the new setting. the first algorithm needs prior knowledge about the lower bound of the expected costs when computing the exploration term. the second algorithm eliminates this need by estimating the minimal expected costs from empirical observations, and therefore can be applied to more real-world applications where prior knowledge is not available. we prove that both algorithms have nice learning abilities, with regret bounds of $o(\ln b)$. furthermore, we show that when applying our proposed algorithms to a previous setting with fixed costs (which can be regarded as our special case), one can improve the previously obtained regret bound. our simulation results on real-time bidding in ad exchange verify the effectiveness of the algorithms and are consistent with our theoretical analysis."

Qualitative Reasoning",Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,"to study mechanisms common across a variety of preference formalisms, we introduce a novel abstract preference framework. it makes no syntactic assumptions and uses most general representations to model the semantics. we use our abstract preference framework to study strong equivalence in preference formalisms, a version of equivalence that guarantees semantic-preserving replacements of parts of preference theories, and is fundamental for preference rewriting and modularity. to this end we identify abstract postulates in the language of preference frameworks, capturing natural semantic properties of preferences, and show that they lead to elegant characterizations, applicable in many practical settings. in a similar way, we study the separability of constraints and preferences. preference languages have to capture constraints on the domain of interest that give rise to intended outcomes, and preferences that describe what is desirable. in many preference formalisms these two objectives are clearly separated, in some others they are not. we identify abstract postulates that guarantee separability of a preference formalism and lead to its separated variant."
29,Equilibria of Online Scheduling Algorithms,online games equilibrium analysis scheduling algorithms competitive queues non-bayesian equilibria,Game Theory,Multiagent Systems,"we describe a model for competitive online scheduling algorithms. two servers, each with a single observable queue, compete for customers. upon arrival, each customer strategically chooses the queue with minimal expected wait time. each scheduler wishes to maximize its number of customers, and can strategically select which scheduling algorithm, such as first-come-first-served (fcfs), to use for its queue. this induces a game played by the servers and the customers. we consider a non-bayesian setting, where servers and customers play to maximize worst-case payoffs. we show that there is a unique subgame perfect safety-level equilibrium and we describe the associated scheduling algorithm (which is not fcfs). the uniqueness result holds for both randomized and deterministic algorithms, with a different equilibrium algorithm in each case. when the goal of the servers is to minimize competitive ratio, we prove that it is an equilibrium for each server to apply fcfs: each server obtains the optimal competitive ratio of 2."

Multiagent Systems","we consider a multi-agent scenario where a collection of agents needs to select a common decision from a large set of possible decisions, over which they express their preferences. such a decision set has a combinatorial structure, that is, each candidate is an element of the cartesian product of the domains of some variables. we assume agents compactly express their preferences over the candidates via soft constraints. we consider various aggregation methods: some are sequential, in the sense that they aggregate the preferences over one variable at a time, and an other one is one-step, i.e., it aggregates the preferences over complete assignments of the variables. we study the complexity of influencing such aggregation methods through bribery: how computationally complex is it for an external agent to determine whether by paying certain agents to change their preferences, within a certain budget, a specified candidate can be made the winner decision? we prove that bribery is np-complete for the considered sequential aggregation methods (based on plurality, approval, and borda) for most of the cost schemes we defined, while the problem is polynomial for one-step plurality."

Robotics","over the course of the last decade, infrared (ir) and particularly thermal ir imaging based face recognition has emerged as a promising complement to conventional, visible spectrum based approaches which continue to struggle when applied in the real world. while inherently insensitive to visible spectrum illumination changes, ir images introduce specific challenges of their own, most notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns, e.g. emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. in addition, facial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in ir images because they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for fitting any deformable model. in this paper we describe a novel method which addresses these major challenges. specifically, to normalize for pose and facial expression changes we generate a synthetic frontal image of a face in a canonical, neutral facial expression from an image of the face in an arbitrary pose and facial expression. this is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows active appearance model (aam) fitting. this is the first publication which explores the use of an aam on thermal ir images; we propose a pre-processing step which enhances detail in thermal images, making aam convergence faster and more accurate. to overcome the problem of thermal ir image sensitivity to the exact pattern of facial temperature emissions we describe a representation based on reliable anatomical features. in contrast to previous approaches, our representation is not binary; rather, our method accounts for the reliability of the extracted features. this makes the proposed representation much more robust both to pose and scale changes. the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the largest public database of thermal ir images of faces on which it achieves perfect recognition performance and significantly outperforms previously described methods."

130,Effective Bilingual Constraints for Semi-supervised Learning of Named Entity Recognizers,gibbs sampling for factored models bilingual constraints for ner semi-supervised learning,Information Extraction,Natural Language Processing,"most semi-supervised methods in natural language processing capitalize on unannotated resources in a single language; however, information can be gained from using parallel resources in more than one language, since translations of the same utterance in different languages can help to disambiguate each other. we demonstrate a method that makes effective use of vast amounts of bilingual text (a.k.a. bitext) to improve monolingual systems. we propose a factored probabilistic sequence model that encourages both crosslanguage and intra-document consistency. a simple gibbs sampling algorithm is introduced for performing approximate inference. experiments on english-chinese named entity recognition (ner) using the ontonotes dataset demonstrate that our method is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art monolingual crf models in a bilingual test setting. our model also improves on previous work by burkett et al. (2010), achieving a relative error reduction of 10.8% and 4.5% in chinese and english, respectively. furthermore, by annotating a moderate amount of unlabeled bi-text with our bilingual model, and using the tagged data for uptraining, we achieve a 9.2% error reduction in chinese over the state-of-the-art stanford monolingual ner system."

Multi-Robot Systems","Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
Robotics","pathfinding for a single agent is the problem of planning a route from an initial location to a goal location in an environment, going around obstacles. pathfinding for multiple agents also aims to plan such routes for each agent, subject to different constraints, such as restrictions on the length of each path or on the total length of paths, no self-intersecting paths, no intersection of paths/plans, no crossing/meeting each other, etc. it also has variations for finding optimal solutions with respect to the maximum path length, the sum of plan lengths, etc. these problems are important for many real-life applications, such as motion planning, vehicle routing, environmental monitoring, patrolling, computer games, etc. motivated by such applications, we introduce a formal framework that is general enough to solve all these problems: we use the expressive high-level representation formalism and efficient solvers of the declarative programming paradigm answer set programming. we also introduce heuristics to improve the computational efficiency and/or solution quality. we show the applicability and usefulness of our framework by experiments, with randomly generated problem instances on a grid, on a real-world road network, and on a real computer game terrain."

Multiagent Systems","scaling multiagent reinforcement learning to domains with many agents is a complex problem. in particular, multiagent credit assignment becomes a key issue as the system size increases. some multiagent systems suffer from a global reward signal that is very noisy or difficult to analyze. this makes deriving a learnable local reward signal very difficult. difference rewards (a particular instance of reward shaping) have been used to alleviate this concern, but they remain difficult to compute in many domains. in this paper we present an approach to modeling the global reward using function approximation that allows the quick computation of local rewards. we demonstrate how this model can result in significant improvements in behavior for three congestion problems: a multiagent ``bar problem'', a complex simulation of the united states airspace, and a generic air traffic domain. we show how the model of the global reward may be either learned on- or off-line using either linear functions or neural networks. for the bar problem, we show an increase in reward of nearly 200% over learning using the global reward directly. for the air traffic problem, we show a decrease in costs of 25% over learning using the global reward directly."

Multiagent Learning","Machine Learning
Multiagent Systems","learning accurate models of agent behaviours is crucial for the purpose of controlling multiagent systems where the agent and environment dynamics are unknown. many multiagent systems exhibit mixed observability, where the multiple interacting agents are heterogenous - observations of some of the agents are essentially perfect and noiseless, while observations of other agents are imperfect, aliased or noisy. predictive state representations are well-suited to model learning but had hitherto not been adapted to such systems. we present a new model learning framework, the mixed observability predictive state representation (mo-psr), which exploits structural properties present in mixed observability multiagent systems to learn models that allow more efficient planning and control. we present a learning algorithm that is scalable to large amounts of data and to large mixed observability domains, and show theoretical analysis of the learning consistency and computational complexity. empirical results demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of learning accurate models, at a larger scale than with the generic predictive state representation, by leveraging the mixed observability properties."

Satisfiability (General/Other)",Constraints and Satisfiability,"recent attempts to create versions of satisfiability (sat) solvers that exploit parallel hardware have met with limited success. in fact, the most successful parallel solvers in recent competitions were based on portfolio approaches with little to no exchange of information between processors. this experience contradicts the apparent parallelizability of exploring a combinatorial search space. we present evidence that this discrepancy can be explained by studying sat solvers as resolution refutation engines. starting with the observation that a recently studied measure of resolution proofs, namely depth, provides a (weak) upper bound to the best possible speedup achievable by such solvers, we empirically show the existence of bottlenecks to parallelizability that refutations typically generated by sat solvers exhibit. further, we propose a new measure that explicitly accounts for a bounded number of parallel processors and empirically correlates with parallel speedups observed in practice. our findings suggest that efficient parallelization of such solvers is not simply a matter of finding the right clause sharing heuristics, it is also hindered by the structure of the refutations these solvers produce."
135,Ties Matter: Complexity of Manipulation when Tie-breaking with a Random Vote,social choice voting manipulation computational complexity,Social Choice / Voting,Multiagent Systems,"we study the impact on strategic voting of tie-breaking by means of considering the order of tied candidates within a random vote. we compare this to another non-deterministic tie-breaking rule where we simply choose between candidates uniformly at random. in general, we demonstrate that there is no connection between the computational complexity of computing a manipulating vote with the two different types of tie-breaking. however, we prove that for some scoring rules, the computational complexity of computing a manipulation can increase from polynomial to np-hard. we also discuss the relationship with the computational complexity of computing a manipulating vote when we ask for an unique winner, or when we select from the set of co-winners."

Multiagent Systems","security games involving the allocation of multiple security resources to defend multiple targets generally have an exponential number of pure strategies for the defender. one method that has been successful in addressing this computational issue is to instead directly compute the marginal probabilities with which the individual resources are assigned (first pursued by kiekintveld et al. (2009)). however, in sufficiently general settings, there exist games where these marginal solutions are not implementable, that is, they do not correspond to any mixed strategy of the defender. in this paper, we examine security games on graphs and show how the type of graph, the type of schedules, and the type of defender resources affect the applicability of this approach. in some settings, we show the approach is applicable and give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal defender strategy; in other settings, we give counterexample games that demonstrate that the approach does not work, and prove np-hardness results for computing an optimal defender strategy."
137,Sample Complexity and Performance Bounds for Non-parametric Approximate Linear Programming,mdp alp reinforcement learning,Reinforcement Learning,Machine Learning,"one of the most difficult tasks in value function approximation for markov decision processes is finding an approximation architecture that is expressive enough to capture the important structure in the value function, while at the same time not overfitting the training samples. recent results in non-parametric approximate linear programming (np-alp), have demonstrated that this can be done effectively using nothing more than a smoothness assumption on the value function. in this paper we extend these results to the case where samples come from real world transitions instead of the full bellman equation, adding robustness to noise. in addition, we provide the first max-norm, finite sample performance guarantees for any form of alp. np-alp is amenable to problems with large (multidimensional) or even infinite (continuous) action spaces, and does not require a model to select actions using the resulting approximate solution."
138,PAC Optimal Exploration in Continuous Space Markov Decision Processes,mdps pac-optimal exploration reinforcement learning,Reinforcement Learning,Machine Learning,"current exploration algorithms can be classified in two broad categories: heuristic, and pac optimal. while numerous researchers have used heuristic approaches such as $\epsilon$-greedy exploration successfully, such approaches lack formal, finite sample guarantees and may need a significant amount of fine-tuning to produce good results. pac optimal exploration algorithms, on the other hand, offer strong theoretical guarantees but are inapplicable in domains of realistic size. the goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, by introducing c-pace, an algorithm which offers strong theoretical guarantees and can be applied to interesting, continuous state problems."

Uncertainty in AI (General/Other)","Reasoning about Plans, Processes, and Actions
Reasoning under Uncertainty","pomdp (partially observable markov decision process) is a mathematical framework that models planning under uncertainty. solving a pomdp is an intractable problem and even the state of the art pomdp solvers are too computationally expensive for large domains. this is a major bottleneck. in this paper, we propose a new heuristic, called the pairwise heuristic, that can be used in a one-step greedy strategy to find a near optimal solution for pomdp problems very quickly. this approach is a good candidate for large problems where real-time solution is a necessity but exact optimality of the solution is not vital. the pairwise heuristic uses the optimal solutions for pairs of states. for each pair of states in the pomdp, we find the optimal sequence of actions to resolve the uncertainty and to maximize the reward, given that the agent is uncertain about which state of the pair it is in. then we use these sequences as a heuristic and find the optimal action in each step of the greedy strategy using this heuristic. we have tested our method on the available large classical test benchmarks in various domains. the resulting total reward is close to, if not greater than, the total reward obtained by other state of the art pomdp solvers, while the time required to find the solution is always much less."

Applications","simple diffusion processes on networks have been used to model, analyze and predict diverse phenomena such as spread of diseases, information, memes, etc. more often than not, the underlying network data is noisy and sampled. this prompts the following natural question: how sensitive are the diffusion dynamics and subsequent conclusions to uncertainty in the network?  in this paper, we consider two popular diffusion models: independent cascades (ic) model and linear threshold (lt) model. we study how the expected number of vertices that are influenced/infected, given some initial conditions, are affected by network perturbation. by rigorous analysis under the assumption of a reasonable perturbation model we establish the following main results: (1) for the ic model, we characterize the susceptibility to network perturbation in terms of the critical probability for phase transition of the network. we find the expected number of infections is quite stable, unless the the transmission probability is close to the critical probability. (2) we show that the standard lt model with uniform edge weights is relatively stable under network perturbations. (3) empirically, the transient behavior, i.e., the time series of the number of infections, in both models appears to be more sensitive to network perturbations. we also study these questions using extensive simulations on diverse real world networks, and find that our theoretical predictions for both models match the empirical observations quite closely."

Transfer, Adaptation, Multitask Learning",Machine Learning,"in a lifelong learning framework, an agent acquires knowledge incrementally over consecutive learning tasks, continually building upon its experience. recent lifelong learning algorithms have achieved nearly identical performance to batch multi-task learning methods while requiring over three orders of magnitude less time to learn. in this paper, we further improve the scalability of lifelong learning by developing curriculum selection methods that enable an agent to actively select the next task to learn in order to maximize performance on future learning tasks. we demonstrate that active task selection is highly reliable and effective, allowing an agent to learn high performance models using up to 50% fewer tasks than when the agent has no control over the task order. we also explore a variant of transfer learning in the lifelong learning setting in which the agent can focus knowledge acquisition toward a particular target task, enabling the agent to quickly learn the target task."
